# **1. V8**

* **What it is**:
  V8 is **Googleâ€™s open-source JavaScript engine**, written in C++.
  It was originally built for the Chrome browser, and Node.js uses it too.

* **Role**:
  V8 takes your **JavaScript code** â†’ **compiles it into machine code** â†’ executes it **very fast**.

* **Key Features**:

  * **JIT compilation (Just-in-Time)**: Converts JS into native machine code at runtime for speed.
  * **Garbage Collection**: Cleans up unused memory automatically.
  * **ECMAScript compliance**: Keeps up with JS standards (ES6, ES2020, etc.).
  * **Embeddable**: Thatâ€™s how Node.js uses it outside the browser.

* **In Node.js**:

  * When you write:

    ```js
    console.log("Hello");
    ```

    â†’ V8 parses, compiles, and executes it.
  * But V8 **alone doesnâ€™t know about files, network, timers, etc.** (those are not part of JavaScript spec).

# **2. libuv**

* **What it is**:
  `libuv` is a **multi-platform C library** that Node.js uses to handle **asynchronous I/O** operations.
  (Originally created for Node.js itself, now used in other projects too).

* **Role**:
  Provides **event loop** + **thread pool** + **asynchronous I/O** (files, network, DNS, timers).

* **Key Features**:

  * **Event loop**: Heart of Node.js async programming model (non-blocking).
  * **Thread pool**: For tasks that canâ€™t be async at OS-level (e.g., file system, crypto).
  * **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.
  * Abstracts OS differences â†’ Node.js APIs behave the same everywhere.

* **In Node.js**:
  Example:

  ```js
  const fs = require("fs");

  fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });
  ```

  * JS call goes into Node.js â†’ libuv puts it into a **thread pool** â†’ once done, callback is queued in the **event loop** â†’ V8 executes the callback.

---

# **3. How They Work Together**

* **V8**: Runs your JavaScript code.
* **libuv**: Handles async operations (I/O, timers, networking).
* **Node.js**: Bridges both, exposing APIs like `fs`, `http`, `setTimeout`.

**Flow Example (setTimeout)**:

1. JS calls `setTimeout(() => {...}, 1000)`.
2. Node.js delegates to **libuv** (timer system).
3. After 1s, libuv puts the callback into the **event loop queue**.
4. V8 picks it up and runs it.

---

# **4. Simple Analogy**

* **V8** = The brain (executes instructions).
* **libuv** = The nervous system (handles signals, background tasks, and timing).
* **Node.js** = The body that brings them together and provides APIs.

---

âœ… **In short**:

* **V8** â†’ Runs JavaScript, compiles to machine code.
* **libuv** â†’ Provides async I/O, event loop, thread pool.
* Together, they make Node.js **fast, non-blocking, and cross-platform**.

# **1. Event Loop**

* **What it is**:
  A **single-threaded loop** (provided by `libuv`) that continuously checks if thereâ€™s any work (callbacks, timers, I/O, promises, etc.) to be executed.

* **Role**:
  Keeps Node.js **non-blocking** and handles asynchronous operations.

* **How it works (phases)**:
  The event loop has multiple **phases**, each for specific types of callbacks:

  1. **Timers** â†’ Executes `setTimeout` and `setInterval` callbacks.
  2. **Pending callbacks** â†’ Executes I/O callbacks deferred from previous operations.
  3. **Idle, prepare** â†’ Internal use (not relevant for most devs).
  4. **Poll** â†’ Retrieves new I/O events, executes I/O callbacks.
  5. **Check** â†’ Executes `setImmediate` callbacks.
  6. **Close callbacks** â†’ Executes `socket.on('close')` etc.

* **Microtasks queue (higher priority)**:

  * **Promises / process.nextTick()** run immediately **after the current operation**, before moving to the next phase.

**Example:**

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log("timeout"), 0);
setImmediate(() => console.log("immediate"));
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("promise"));

console.log("sync");
```

ðŸ‘‰ Output order:

```
sync
promise
timeout
immediate
```

(Event loop & microtasks decide this order!)

---

# **2. Thread Pool**

* **What it is**:
  A pool of **4 threads (by default)** inside `libuv` (can be increased using `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE`).

* **Role**:
  Handles tasks that **cannot be done asynchronously by the OS** and would otherwise block the event loop.

* **Examples of operations using thread pool**:

  * File system operations (`fs.readFile`, `fs.writeFile`)
  * DNS lookups (`dns.lookup`)
  * Some crypto operations (`crypto.pbkdf2`, `crypto.scrypt`)
  * Compression (zlib)

**Example:**

```js
const fs = require("fs");

fs.readFile("bigfile.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  console.log("File read done");
});

console.log("Doing other work...");
```

ðŸ‘‰ `fs.readFile` runs in **thread pool**, so event loop is free to continue.
When file reading finishes, result is sent back â†’ callback queued in event loop â†’ executed by V8.

# **3. Event Loop vs Thread Pool**

| Feature           | Event Loop (Single Thread)                | Thread Pool (Multiple Threads)       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **What it does**  | Runs JS code & schedules async tasks      | Handles heavy I/O & CPU-bound tasks  |
| **How many**      | Only **1** per process                    | Default **4 threads** (can scale up) |
| **Examples**      | Timers, Promises, `setImmediate`          | `fs`, `dns`, `crypto`, `zlib`        |
| **Blocking risk** | If a task runs too long, everything stops | Offloads heavy work, avoids blocking |

---

# **4. Simple Analogy**

* **Event Loop** = Waiter in a restaurant (takes orders, serves food, manages customers).
* **Thread Pool** = Kitchen staff (cooks food in background).
* The waiter (event loop) never cooks (doesnâ€™t block), but passes tasks to the kitchen (thread pool).

---

âœ… **In short**:

* **Event Loop** â†’ Single-threaded manager that executes JS and schedules async tasks.
* **Thread Pool** â†’ Background workers (in libuv) for heavy tasks (file system, crypto, DNS).
* Together â†’ Node.js is **fast, non-blocking, and scalable**.
